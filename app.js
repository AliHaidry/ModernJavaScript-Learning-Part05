/** REST APIs & HTTP Request */
/** 
 * What is an API?
 * Application Programming Interface.
 * Contract provided by one piece of software to another.
 * Structured request and response.
 * We just worked with an API that takes a request and responds with jokes.
 * 
 * What is REST APIs?
 * Representational State Transfer.
 * Architecture style for designing networked applications.
 * Relies on a stateless, client-server protocol, almost always HTTP.
 * Treats server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed.
 * Can be used by virtually any programming language.
 * All APIs have their own rules and structure.
 * 
 * HTTP Requests
 * GET : Retrieve data from a specified resource.
 * POST : Submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
 * PUT : Update a specified resource.
 * DELETE : Delete a specified resource.
 *
 * 
 * HEAD : Same as get but does not return a body.
 * OPTIONS : Returns the supported HTTP methods.
 * PATCH : Update partial resources.
